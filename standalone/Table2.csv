Measurement,N,R,Ease of use,Repeatability,Considerations
Upper jaw length,437,0.946,3,4,Bony part; can measure on right or left side.  Electronic Calipers tended to malfunction when longer measurements attempted; had to use manual calipers for >15cm distances; somewhat awkward to measure. The end of the maxilla can be hard to define. Must ensure caliper is in center of snout
Eye diameter,438,0.880,3,2,"Easy to define where to hold the calipers in the eye socket, but the tissue is soft/stretchy so its difficult to know how hard to press against the flesh; can measure on right or left side. Uses the outside rather than the inside of the calipers (? slower); Soft tissue so repeatability is questionable; somewhat awkward to measure"
Interorbital distance,437,0.943,5,5,Bony part;  Easy to define where to hold calipers; so far there has been no reason (eg damage) to not include this measurement 
Snout length,437,0.954,4,5,Bony part; can measure on right or left side; must ensure caliper is in centre of snout
Post orbital to pre-operculum,426,0.930,4,5,Bony part; can measure on right or left side.  Maybe need to improve definition of instruction of where to hold caliper on pre-operculum 
Post orbital head length,130,0.914,3,2,"Can measure on right or left side. Operculum was cut off on some fish, likely to be cut off on commercially caught fish. Electronic Calipers tended to malfunction when longer measurements attempted; had to use manual calipers for >15 cm distances"
