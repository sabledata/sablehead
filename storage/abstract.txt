Routine biological sampling of whole round sablefish from commercial fishing operations have
occurred since the early 1990â€™s. Specimens have historically been obtained through a voluntary
catch sampling program and tagged sablefish recovery program. In order to improve the quantity
and range of samples received, we investigated the potential for obtaining biological information
using heads, rather than the entire fish. In 2016, scientific sampling of 438 sablefish (240-
1080 mm) occurred on two DFO Groundfish Synoptic Bottom Trawl surveys and one salmon
survey(?). Six different fish head measurements were collected and assessed to see if they
could predict fork length. In 2017, a pilot study was conducted with head-only samples and
sex determination provided by a commercial crew. Sampling included a rating system to rank
the repeatability of each head dimension by multiple technicians. DNA-based sex identification
methods were employed to test fisher-determined sex accuracy. The results suggest that the
interorbital distance measurement demonstrated highest repeatability and a strong relationship
to fork length. Genetic results indicate accurate fisher sex detection (?). Subsequently, the 2018
sampling collection program was modified so that returns of whole round sablefish were replaced
by head-only samples with knife cuts on the operculum to indicate sex.
