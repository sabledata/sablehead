MEASUREMENT,INSTRUCTIONS FOR POSITIONING CALIPERS
Eye Diameter (anterior-posterior diameter of eye socket),Use the outward-facing points of the calipers. Stretch them firmly against the eye socket at the vertical midpoint of the eye
,
"InterOrbital Distance (narrowest distance between eye sockets, measured on dorsal surface)",Measure at the horizontal midpoint of the eyes on the dorsal surface.
,
Snout length (tip of snout to anterior inner edge of eye socket),"Measure from the most forward point/centre of the snout, to the horizontal midpoint of the anterior edge of the eye socket"
,
Upper jaw length (tip of snout to the posterior edge of the maxilla),Measure from the most forward point/centre of the snout to the back of the maxilla.
,
Post orbital head length (Posterior inner edge of orbit to dorsal insertion of opercle),"Measure from the back of the eye socket (caliper vertically centred), to the ‘gill cover notch’ at the dorsal insertion of the opercle.  Hold the operculum taut and measure to the bone underneath the gill cover notch rather than to the flap of skin that forms the notch itself."
Post orbital to preoperculum distance (posterior inner edge of orbit to visual insertion point of preopercle)?Need to re-word?,"Measure from the back of the eye socket (caliper vertically centred), to the preopercle.  Lift the preopercle away from the fish slightly so that you can see the preopercle bone underneath the skin. Measure to the point at which you can see the preopercle bone insertion point (this will be underneath the skin and won’t necessarily be where the gill slit ends."
