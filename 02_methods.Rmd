Sablefish head morphometric project: Summary Mar 15, 2017.

1.	431 Sablefish heads were collected on the 2016 WCVI and WCHG surveys using a trip-wide length stratified sampling protocol.

2.	The 438 heads measured were from fish that ranged from 240-1080 mm fork length. 212 were collected on trip 79190 (WCVI), and 219 were from trip 80378 (WCHG).  In addition to measuring the head dimensions as described below, we collected tissue for DNA analysis (small fin clips collected in to 95% Ethanol) from the first 138 fish measured, and otoliths from every specimen (excluding the 7 small sablefish collected on the salmon survey).

3.	Definition of 6 head dimensions measured and instructions for positioning the calipers (Table \@ref(tab:table1)).

4.	Each measurement was ranked in terms of ‘Ease of Use’ and ‘Repeatability’
