##  Experimental Study 2016

Sablefish were selected for sampling during the 2016 biennial DFO Groundfish Synoptic Bottom Trawl surveys, following a trip-wide length stratified selection protocol. A tally of 212 fish were sampled on the West Coast Vancouver Island survey [@Williams2018] and 219 fish were sampled on the West Coast Haida Gwaii survey [@Nottingham2018]. In addition, seven small sablefish were collected during the 2016 salmon survey (Figure \@ref(fig:figure1)). 

For each selected fish, fork length, round weight, sex and maturity were recorded at sea. The heads were removed, labelled and frozen.  On shore, the cranial dimensions were measured using Mitutoyo AbsoluteÂ® 500-762-20 coolant proof digimatic calipers and sagittal otoliths were collected for future ageing.  A number of fish head dimensions were considered as possible candidates for estimating fork length:  upper jaw length (L~UJ~), eye diameter (L~ED~), interorbital distance (L~ID~), snout length (L~SL~), post orbital to preoperculum distance (L~PP~), and post orbital (L~PO~) head length (Table \@ref(tab:table1), Appendix \@ref(app:first-appendix)). Fork lengths (L~FL~) were estimated by a simple linear regression model, using the cranial measurements as a predictor variables.  

At the time of sampling, each cranial dimension was evaluated by experienced samplers on a five point rating scale in terms of two distinct criteria: 1. ease of use and 2. repeatability. The ease of use metric focused on three key attributes of the measurement learn-ability (task understanding), efficiency (task-completion time) and degree of difficulty (task performance ease).  The repeatability metric focused on ranking each measurement under repeated caliper placement, taking into consideration the soft and hard head tissues. 

Operculum clips (DNA) were collected from the first 137 fish measured (79 male and 58 female) and forwarded to the Molecular Genetics Laboratory (MGL) for gender test development.



### Molecular Genetics Laboratory (MGL) genetic sex-determination

DNA multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were conducted using fluorescently labelled forward primers.	X-insert and Y-insert specific primers developed by @Rondeau2013 were used, but the X-insert forward and Y-nested reverse were redesigned to produce slightly smaller PCR products (Table \@ref(tab:table2)).   Sex specific alleles were size fractionated in an ABI 3730 capillary DNA analyzer and were scored with ABI GeneMapper using an internal lane sizing standard. 

## Pilot study 2017

In 2017, a pilot study was conducted with the commercial sector returning sablefish head only samples.  A total of 360 heads were collected from J-cut sablefish on a limited-entry fishery trip to the Cobb and Eickelberg seamounts (Figure \@ref(fig:figure1)).  Each operculum was marked by commercial fishers with either one knife cut (male) or two knife cuts (female) (Appendix \@ref(app:second-appendix)).  

Scientific sampling occurred on shore, with the first 99 heads of the pilot study measured by three samplers for L~ID~, L~SL~, L~UJ~ and L~PP~.  Given that three highly experienced technicians were used to conduct the same measurements of the each head morphometric, the Index of Average Error (IAE) (Beamish 1981) was calculated to find the most consistent cranial measurement. It is defined as:
$$
IAE=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\frac{1}{R}\sum_{i = 1}^{R}\frac{ - X_j|}{X_j}\right]
$$
where N is the number of sablefish measured for each cranial measurement, R is the number of times each cranial measurement was taken, $X_{ij}$ is the average cranial length for the jth sablefish, and $X_{ij}$ is the ith cranial measurement of the jth sablefish.

Fin clips (95 of 99) were forwarded to the molecular genetics lab for an audit of fisher sex determination.
