##Estimation of Fork Length using Cranial Measurements

Mitutoyo ABSOLUTEÂ® 500-762-20 Coolant Proof Digimatic Caliper

### Survey sample collection 

Measurements of fork length (FL), round weight (RW), upper jaw length (UJ), eye diameter (ED), interorbital distance (IO), snout length (SL), post orbital to preoperculum distance (PP), and post orbital head length (PH) were obtained from sablefish caught on selected surveys (Table \@ref(tab:table1)).  Fish sex and maturity were recorded and sagittal otoliths and operculum clips (DNA) were collected at sea. 


### Pilot study sample Collection

In 2017, a pilot study was conducted with the commercial sector returning sablefish heads, rather than the entire fish.  A total of 360 heads were collected from J-cut sablefish on a trip to the S$\text{\underline{G}}$aan $\text{\underline{K}}$inghlas - Bowie (SK-B) seamount.  Each operculum was marked with either one knife cut (male) or two knife cuts (female) (Appendix \@ref(app:second-appendix) ).  The first 99 heads of the pilot study were measured by three technicians for IO, SN, UJ and PP lengths. 


### Sampling on shore

On shore,  the heads were thawed, and cranial dimensions were measured using electronic calipers. Ageing structures (sagittal otoliths) were also collected from each head.  Operculum clips were collected from the first 137 fish measured (79 male and 58 female), and were stored in vials containing 95% ethanol, to be used for DNA extraction and the development of a genetic test for fish gender. 

### Head measurements

The six cranial dimensions were ranked by samplers on a five point rating scale in terms of ease of use and repeatability with electronic Mitutoyo 500 series calipers. The ease of use metric focused on three key attributes of measurement learnability (task understanding), efficiency (task-completion time) and difficulty (task performance ease).  The repeatability metric focused on ranking the efficiency of a measurement for repeated caliper placement, taking into consideration the soft and hard head tissues.

## Genetic test development

DNA multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were conducted using fluorescently labelled forward primers.	X-insert and Y-insert specific primers developed by @Rondeau2013 were used, but the X-insert forward and Y-nested reverse were redesigned to produce slightly smaller PCR products.   

## Pilot study






# Discussion

Routine biological sampling procedures have been modified so that commercial fisheries are now only returning heads, rather than entire fish.
