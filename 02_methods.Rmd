# Methods

## Sample collection and evaluation

Measurements of fork length (FL), round weight (RW), upper jaw length (UJ), eye diameter (ED), interorbital distance (ID), snout length (SL), post orbital to preoperculum distance (PP), and post orbital head length (PH) were obtained from 212 sablefish caught during the 2016 West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) survey [@Williams2018 and 219 sablefish caught during the 2016 West Coast Haida Gwaii (WCHG) survey [@Nottingham2018]. Seven small sablefish were collected during the 201? salmon survey.  In addition, sagittal otoliths and operculum clips were collected.  Fish sex and maturity were recorded at sea (Table \@ref(tab:table1)).    

The six cranial dimensions were considered as possible candidates for estimating fork length.  Post orbital head lengths (PH)  were abandoned after 130 fish due to measurement difficulties (Table \@ref(tab:table1)).  Each of the 6 head dimensions were measured by Mitutoyo absolute 500-??? digital calipers and ranked in terms of ease of use and repeatability.   (Table \@ref(:table2)). 

Later, a pilot study was conducted on the feasability of the commercial sector returning heads, rather than entire fish.  In 2017, 360 heads were collected from J-cut sablefish on a trip to the Bowie Seamount.  Each operculum was marked with either one knife cut (male) or two knife cuts (female) (Figure x)  The first 99 heads of the pilot study were measured by 3 technicians for IO, SN, UJ and PP.  

## Genetic test 


## Pilot Collection of Sablefish Heads

Heads were received by DFO in good condition (intact and not deformed), segregated by set, for measuring and otolith extraction.  Operculum cuts worked well to indicate sex


## Model evaluation


# Discussion

Routine biological sampling procedures have been modified so that commercial fisheries are now only returning heads, rather than entire fish
